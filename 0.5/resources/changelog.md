### {{site.project_title}}

#### General

"MDV" has been broken up into several new repositories to sepearate out the prollyfills
from the {{site.project_title}} pieces. New repos:

- [polymer-expressions](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-expressions) - {{site.project_title}}'s template binding syntax.
- [NodeBind](https://github.com/Polymer/NodeBind) - prollyfill for `Node.bind()`
- [TemplateBinding](https://github.com/Polymer/TemplateBinding) - prollyfill for Template Bindings.
- [observe-js](http://github.com/Polymer/observe-js) - library for observing Arrays, Objects, and PathValues

**Features**

- `created()` replaces the `ready()` lifecycle callback in the `Polymer()` constructor. `ready()` is still supported for backwards compatibility ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/08c6a4709d6eb5e2eeb47580e593fbe58f7b39ab))
- `<polymer-element noscript>` is back ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/29c523a9a05359722270e945f807e6b528778d52)). See [registering an element](/polymer.html#alternate-ways-to-register-an-element).

### {{site.project_title}}

#### General

**Changes**

- [Auto-registrationn](#general-2013-07-11) of `<polymer-element>`s (e.g. not needing `<script>Polymer()</script>`) has been temporarily removed due to timing issue with the way native Custom Elements (will) work.

## 2013-07-11 {#r2013-07-11}

See the [full list of changes](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/releases/tag/v0.0.20130711).

### {{site.project_title}}

#### General {#general-2013-07-11}

All hail `<polymer-element>`!

Declaring elements is now `<polymer-element name="tag-name">` (was `<element name="tag-name">`).
Elements are now auto registered, so a script tag is no longer required:

    <polymer-element name="tag-name">
      <template>...</template>
    </polymer-element>

**Features**

More complex elements are registered with `Polymer('tag-name', {prototype})` (was `Polymer.register(this, {prototype})`). This allows for more flexible script decoupling:

1. `<script src>` works now
1. `<script>` can come before or inside the element, but not after

**Changes**

1. Script scope is no longer special (e.g. `this` no longer refers to the element).
1. Closures are not longer supported for private variables. Private vars should be done
with the standard methods like anonymous self calling functions.

#### Core

- `.resetStyleInheirtance` can now be defined on the element's prototype ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/411d53c34c9121952f0be66f761a1a1a13f8c78e))
- Shadow DOM shhim styling has been moved into platform as `ShadowCSS` ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/ae24b2a8e288747cfc178282de927d54050f9b5a))

### Platform

- Polyfill `<template>`/`<element>` styling not use `!important`. Fixes [#191](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/191).
- Add `array()` and `forEach()` to `NodeList`, `NamedNodeMap`, `HTMLCollection` ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/platform/commit/32c1f4a7df6bce56586134908f2d98ab616e7dac))

#### Custom Elements

- Script execution is more specific to JS ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/CustomElements/commit/bdc3139c9c0ac04dd748668d05a10625df889b3f))

#### HTML Imports

- Scripts within `<template>` content are now executed. Fixes [#22](https://github.com/Polymer/HTMLImports/issues/22).
- Non-JS script tags are no longer parsed ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/HTMLImports/commit/0f35bd21fab3e0e9b99b525581d1135f27787dd1))

#### MDV

- CompoundBindings have been sped up ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/mdv/commit/27b9cc6dfa69745aadb862780ae71b905e74014f), [commit](https://github.com/Polymer/mdv/commit/b01b4867805311f3815f4e065cea0ced5dd4d4a2))
- Binds have a more consistent API ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/mdv/commit/95c4eca5a89ed3d04af1c6607a61f49d35d05ca6))
- Initial work on MDV benchmarking ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/mdv/commit/79b3d33bc199315f1424ff9ef072ec44e0482668))
- Ensure `getInstanceModel()` is only called when a new instance will be created. Allows for the common case of inserting an instance via a `DocumentFragment` ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/mdv/commit/694a4114779a9cd8ea3c915d1f5e9ec5ad6bd68c))

#### Pointer Events

- Use ES6 `Map` where available ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/PointerEvents/commit/84ac51c69a2e53fafb7e00696917bb260d760497))

## 2013-06-17 {#r2013-06-17}

**Notice**: This release contains important changes to the structure of the project.
{:.centered .alert .alert-info}

The repo structure was "flattened" such that `platform` and `polymer` repos no
longer contain submodules. Instead, the dependencies need to be checked out as siblings.
For example, `platform` now expects `HTMLImports`, `CustomElements`, `PointerEvents`, `MDV`, `ShadowDOM`, etc. to be siblings. `polymer` expects to be siblings with all of them. **Unless you're
working directly on {{site.project_title}}, it's safe to stick with [`polymer-all`](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-all/tree/master).**

### {{site.project_title}}

#### General

- The [Bower component](https://github.com/components/polymer) has been updated to reflect
this release.
- {{site.project_title}}-based [TodoMVC app](http://todomvc.com/labs/architecture-examples/polymer/index.html) ([source](https://github.com/Polymer/todomvc)) was published.
- [MDV Expression Syntax](https://github.com/Polymer/mdv/blob/master/docs/expression_syntax.md) is on by default ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/5b869b5b03880435c288383a042a366314914ea7)). No changes are necessary for your current usage of templates. New features include support for inline math expressions, named scoping, and more. [Read more](https://github.com/Polymer/mdv/blob/master/docs/expression_syntax.md).
- To reduce memory leaks, **elements created 1.) in JavaScript (e.g. `document.createElement('x-foo')`) and 2.) not in the DOM will lose their bindings, asynchronously**. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/5b869b5b03880435c288383a042a366314914ea7))
  - If you want an element to remain *active* when it's not in the `document`
  (e.g. it keeps its MDV bindings and `*Changed` methods), you must call
  `this.cancelUnbindAll()` after it's been created or removed. The `ready()` callback
  is a good place for creation time.
  - If you call `cancelUnbindAll()` and never put the element back in the DOM,
  it is your responsibility to eventually call `this.unbindAll()/asyncUnbindAll()`. Otherwise, you will leak memory.

#### Core

- Arrays and Objects are supported as attributes ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/8bdeba4ffafba4997f47387435e32c800cff8e9f))
- Polyfill support for `:scope` instead of `@host` ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/e226596c0504b651f3b1bc48093f9cd02adc247e))
- Style are correctly applied to type extension custom elements (e.g. `[is="x-foo"]`) ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/4b64c878c82a2d51b253565e988e081e09497994))
- The other lifecycle callbacks (`inserted`, `removed`, `attributeChanged`) can
  be setup in the `Polymer.register()` call in addition to `ready`. **Note**: these
  names are shorter than the spec's API.

### Platform

### Toolkit

* If you're writing a [Toolkit component](/polymer.html), there's
no longer need to include `webcomponents.js` alongside `toolkit.js`. `toolkit.js` now loads `webcomponents.js` under the hood.

### Platform

#### CustomElements

* The `constructor` attribute is now supported ([commit](https://github.com/polymer/CustomElements/commit/96417cf084daf1421a9786e39282206f4ef6d35e))

#### HTML Imports

* Fixed issue with imports loaded at the same url would not have the content associated with them ([commit](https://github.com/polymer/HTMLImports/commit/882a9b6cc53d41d46967346b0b7e32edc4a6f7b9))

* Polyfill now correctly checks for `HTMLTemplateElement` before using it ([commit](https://github.com/polymer/HTMLImports/commit/24283edea12b36ae0db0e7f928fdcb20a6e46eda))

* If `HTMLTemplateElement.bootstrap` is available, then bootstrap templates in imported documents. ([commit](https://github.com/polymer/HTMLImports/commit/8c842e1c1bf3f13ca2097386886874f873e8ec0b))

## 2013-04-11 {#r2013-04-11}

**Notice**: This release contains important changes to the structure of the project.
{:.centered .alert .alert-info}

* The `toolkit` repository now brings in the `platform` repository as a submodule.
* Until now, the _dev_ branch has been the development branch and _master_ has
been the stable release. Now, the _stable_ branch is the default "stable" codebase.
_master_ branches are the in-development tip of tree. The _stable_ branch is also
the default view on Github.

### Toolkit

* `g-component.html` no longer exists as the Tookit kernel. It has been replaced
with loading in `toolkit.js` instead.
* Added `debug` [runtime flags](/docs/polymer/runtime-config.html) to conditionally load debug
version of `webcomponents.js`.

## 2013-02-25 {#r2013-02-25}

### Toolkit

* Changed "toolkit/src" folder name to "toolkit/components". Update your source paths accordingly.

* Introduced `selectedClass` property to g-selector component. ([commit](https://github.com/polymer/polymer/commit/a1565b536ea05cddf7a5984c15017c2bc803d1e5))

* g-selector now sends an `activate` event which is fired whenever an item is activated (can occur when the currently selected item is activated). The `select` event is fired only when the selected item changes. ([commit](https://github.com/polymer/polymer/commit/5aaddd82d89796b493726d31fb5ab2d73a7e1770))

* g-menu-button: the menu now closes in response to the selector's activate event ([commit](https://github.com/polymer/polymer/commit/5aaddd82d89796b493726d31fb5ab2d73a7e1770))

* g-selection: selecting the same item is now a no-op ([commit](https://github.com/polymer/polymer/commit/0075c4c4c39afa1235e8afd3580099f6c530a5ff))

* Added support for 2-way bindings on input elements ([commit](https://github.com/polymer/polymer/commit/16715bbb25fbb8a97455e66cd17021b7761ae0ad))

* g-ajax: Response is bindable; params can be set as json or object.

* g-panels: Added `autoselect` property that controls if keys/swipes can select panels; added `canselect` event to control if a panel can be selected.

### Platform

* Landed version 2 of the Shadow DOM shim. See the [pull request](https://github.com/polymer/polyfills/pull/88) for details.

* ShadowRoot now installs shadow reference on `node.webkitShadowRoot`, as per spec. Fixes [#68](https://github.com/polymer/polymer/issues/68). ([commit](https://github.com/polymer/polymer/commit/34363b6093674956118d8d82cea389961d0e5337))

* Loader: allow stylesheets and scripts in components defined in document. ([commit](https://github.com/polymer/polymer/commit/9875a08fb3f0b153ea044d19b8b3b39cf6e3656c))

### Tools

* Shadow DOM inspector
Added a tool for inspecting Shadow DOM trees. You can invoke the tool via <code>window.sinspect(<em>node</em>)</code>, where `node` is the element to start inspecting from. If not specified then it will use `document.body`.

To use the tool, open the JavaScript console and type `sinspect()`.

**Note**: The tool opens in a pop-up window so you may have to unblock it.
