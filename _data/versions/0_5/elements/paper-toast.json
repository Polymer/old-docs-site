  "description": "\n`paper-toast` provides lightweight feedback about an operation in a small popup \nat the base of the screen on mobile and at the lower left on desktop. Toasts are \nabove all other elements on screen, including the FAB.\n\nToasts automatically disappear after a timeout or after user interaction \nelsewhere on the screen, whichever comes first. Toasts can be swiped off \nscreen.  There can be only one on the screen at a time.\n\nExample:\n\n    <paper-toast text=\"Your draft has been discarded.\" onclick=\"discardDraft(el)\"></paper-toast>\n    \n    <script>\n      function discardDraft(el) {\n        el.show();\n      }\n    <\\/script>\n    \nAn action button can be presented in the toast.\n\nExample (using Polymer's data-binding features):\n\n    <paper-toast id=\"toast2\" text=\"Connection timed out. Showing limited messages.\">\n      <div style=\"color: blue;\" on-tap=\"{{retry}}\">Retry</div>\n    </paper-toast>\n    \nPositioning toast:\n\nA standard toast appears near the lower left of the screen.  You can change the\nposition by overriding bottom and left positions.\n\n    paper-toast {\n      bottom: 40px;\n      left: 10px;\n    }\n    \nTo position the toast to the right:\n\n    paper-toast {\n      right: 10px;\n      left: auto;\n    } \n  \nTo make it fit at the bottom of the screen:\n\n    paper-toast {\n      bottom: 0;\n      left: 0;\n      width: 100%;\n    }\n  \nWhen the screen size is smaller than the `responsiveWidth` (default to 480px),\nthe toast will automatically fits at the bottom of the screen.\n\n",
