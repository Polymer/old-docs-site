  "description": "\n\nImplements the default landing page for Polymer components.\n\n`<core-component-page>` can render an information page for any component.\nPolymer components use this component in `index.html` to provide the standard landing page.\n\n`<core-component-page>` is _vulcanized_, which means it contains all it's dependencies baked in.\nTherefore, this component is intended to be used only by itself in a page.\n\nThis *-dev package contains the raw source and the dependency manifest necessary\nto reconstruct `core-component-page/core-component-page.html` via vulcanize. To vulcanize,\ncheck out the core-component-page repo alongside this repo and run build.sh. This will\ndrop the vulcanize output into `core-component-page/core-component-page.html`.\n\nNote: `<core-component-page>` sets the page title automatically.\n\n\n",
