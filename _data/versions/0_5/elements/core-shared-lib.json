If this is the case, specify the `callbackName` property.\n\nWhere possible, you should use an HTML Import to load library dependencies. Rather than using this element,\ncreate an import (`<link rel=\"import\" href=\"lib.html\">`) that wraps loading the .js file:\n\nlib.html:\n\n    <script src=\"lib.js\"><\\/script>\n\n",
